###TASK
Build a Voting System smart contract with these features:

1. Register candidates (add names).
2. Allow users to vote for a candidate.
3. Track and display the total votes for each candidate.
4. Prevent users from voting more than once to keep it fair.

###IMPLEMENTATION
This will help practice functions, mappings, and basic logic.
Started out by diving straight into it without realizing i had to stop break down the steps and tackle them one at a time . And also had to figure out the whole logic of how the contract should be like .

so i tried to break it down buh i got stuck then i consulted AI to help simplify the tasks and the flow 
Then i started to work on the codes , after that i compiled then deployed and i wasn't getting the expected results from some of the functions . Tried debugging which is really difficult since it was a logical error , then consulted AI which assisted in fixing the error and provided suggestions. Deployed again and it works as expected .
