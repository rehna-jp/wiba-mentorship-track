##### BUILD A SIMPLE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM
Users can create a fundraising campaign with a goal.
Supporters can send ETH to fund the campaign.
The owner can withdraw funds only if the goal is met.
Contributors can get refunds if the goal isn’t reached.
...This teaches functions, condition checks, and handling ETH

##### IMPLEMENTATION
Started this by separating the users into campaign owners and contributors
then worked on implementing the functions to add a campaign , to fund campaigns, to withdraw contributed funds and a refund fund function for when the campaign goals are not met, and also a totalfunds variable that displays the total funds contributed . I also implemented the ability to view the campaign owner's address
