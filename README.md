#  WIBA Mentorship Program 2.0 Curriculum – Blockchain Development Track

**Goal:**
Equip mentees with the skills to design, build, and deploy blockchain systems, develop smart contracts, and explore Layer 2 scaling solutions, while ensuring security and real-world application.
#  Week 1: Foundations
Topics: Blockchain fundamentals, consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, PoA).
Environment setup: Remix, Hardhat, Foundry.
Weekly Task: Install a dev environment and deploy a sample contract on Remix.

#  Week 2: Smart Contracts I
Topics: Solidity basics, writing first smart contracts, EVM overview.
Weekly Task: Write and deploy a simple “Hello Blockchain” contract.

#  Week 3: Smart Contracts II
Topics: Hardhat/Foundry workflows, contract inheritance, ERC standards (ERC-20, ERC-721).
Weekly Task: Build and deploy a custom ERC-20 token on testnet.

#  Week 4: Layer 2 Scaling
Topics: Rollups, Sidechains, Plasma, Polygon/Arbitrum testnets.
Weekly Task: Deploy a smart contract on a Layer 2 testnet and compare transaction costs.


#  Week 5: Security & Testing
Topics: Contract vulnerabilities (Reentrancy, Overflow), secure coding practices, testing with Hardhat.
Weekly Task: Identify and fix vulnerabilities in a buggy smart contract provided by mentors.

#  Week 6: Capstone Project & Demo
Topics: Final dApp build, project presentations.
Weekly Task: Build a simple dApp (e.g., a voting app, NFT minting dApp, or micro DeFi app).

#  Outcome: Present one member project during the Final Showcase.
#  Bonus: Career Development Add-On (Week 6)

**Mentors share internship and job opportunities in Web3/startups.
Guidance on how to apply effectively (resume, cover letter, GitHub/portfolio, interview tips).
Outcome by End of Track:
Understanding blockchain architecture and consensus models.
Ability to write, deploy, and secure smart contracts.
Familiarity with Layer 2 scaling solutions.
Delivery of a working dApp as a capstone project.**

#  ⚠️ Disclaimer
**This curriculum is flexible. Depending on mentees’ prior knowledge and experience, mentors may adjust, combine, or skip modules to ensure the learning journey is practical, engaging, and suited to the group’s level. Blog posts are strongly encouraged but can vary in depth (short reflections or detailed case studies).
